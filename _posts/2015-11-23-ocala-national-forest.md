description: "Maryellen Kennedy Duckett The Ocala National Forest, north of Orlando, is the world's largest contiguous sand pine scrub forest at nearly 383,000 acres. That means that a sand ridge of dunes, which were once a chain of islands before the sea retreated 25 million years ago, runs through an area primarily populated by sand pines."
